# WebAppCalculator

This is an example application to demonstrate a simple calculation(adding two integers together) using the MVC Architecture, Servlet's and JSP's.

Process: 
index.jsp will ask for two whole numbers and by pressing "RUN" it should add those numbers and responde with "result.jsp" but I keep on getting a "404" and does not find the page.
The initial page:

The second page should show the result but it does not:
